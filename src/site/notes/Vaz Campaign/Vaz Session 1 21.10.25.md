[[Vaz Campaign/The Execution of Saint Godwin\|The Execution of Saint Godwin]]
The world we live in is named Ara'kiel.

Today, [[VNPC's/Godwin Medeus\|Godwin Medeus]] was executed, hanged publicly before all of our eyes.. 

[[VPlayer Characters/Aurinka Taiva\|Aurinka]] forced herself to watch, etching every detail of the scene into her very memory, even as her body told her to look away, to make sure she wouldn't ever forget this scene.

Before the hanging took place, [[VPlayer Characters/Lerlund Medeus\|Lerlund Medeus]] had a short but heavy exchange with his older brother. Godwin asked what meal he would be eating, and urged his brother to eat a feast that day, whereas Lerlund only emptily replied that he wouldn't eat at all on a day like this. Before the conversation forcefully came to an end, Godwin asked Lerlund to make sure that his niece ([[VNPC's/Vittoria Medeus\|Vittoria Medeus]]), would take her medicine that day.

[[VPlayer Characters/Barlast\|Barlast]] had a solemn look on his face, though he tried not to show it.

[[VPlayer Characters/Rion B. Everhope\|Rion]]'s tail was still, she wanted this execution to be over with as soon as possible. She hated every single moment of it. She opened one of her books to record the scene and the final words of the paladin.

Rion is going to take out one of her books and stars writing down the scene and notes down the words Godwin said.

[[VNPC's/Arkhan the Cruel\|Arkhan]] the Dragonborn stared down at Aurinka, grinning at her, stating: *"Do not tell me, that you're feeling remorse for a traitor are you?"*
Aurinka replied weakly: *"No...of course not"* to where the aasimar could only look away, shaking.

The crown continued on with the execution, with the crowd and all of it's members watching, some in awe and some in fear.

The funeral will take place at Lerlund's and Vittoria's abode.

[[VNPC's/Marcus\|Marcus]] a Golden Dragonborn and former knight (Who knows Barlast, Lerlund and Rion), returned from his trip to the east where he sought for allies. Only to find, that the most courageous of the revolution had gotten caught. 

Marcus now carried the will of Godwin.

And it is clear, that someone ratted the revolutionaries out. (Even if only partially.)

[[VNPC's/Jam\|Jam]], a goblin Inquisitor associated with house Medani (The same house which Aurinka is in.), came by with Aurinka whom is a part of the crown. Carrying Godwin's sword.

[[VNPC's/The Leonin Twins\|The Leonin Twins]]

[[Yeoli\|Yeoli]] and [[Koli\|Koli]],

## The Will of Godwin Medeus

- **Marcus**: entrusted with the will.  Protector of the smallfolk and western lands.
- **Rion**: received Godwin’s journal, encrypted, with possible information about _him_.
- **Jam**: received a dagger.
- **Yeoli and Koli** ([[VNPC's/The Leonin Twins\|The Leonin Twins]]): received a chess set. (To hopefully become smarter.)
- **Barlast**: received a quarterstaff, a druidic relic passed through the southern grove and once held by the 7th Scout Division before Godwin obtained it.
- **Lerlund**: inherited the estate and all possessions not otherwise named in the will, until Vittoria comes of age.
- **Vittoria**: shared ownership of the estate with Lerlund.
- **A letter** was addressed to Erika, Godwin’s former lover and mother of his child.

Wine is from the Northern provinces near the Iron Tower. Was Godwin's favourite.

Rion B. Everhope seems to likes grape juice very much.
Doesn't like nor drinks alcohol.
Aurinka got a mix of wine and grape juice.
Lerlund got wine only
Barlast got a glass of wine and a glass of juice separately

Aurinka complained that both Lerlund's salad and Marcus' wine tasted **awful.**
It turned out that Lerlund's salad was made using rotten vegetables, which the fighter decided to only cut off the visibly rotten parts in his cooking, assuming that the food would still be edible in the process.

Lerlund and Godwin used to be smugglers?

It was revealed by Rion by accident that Godwin was an aasimar, just like Aurinka.
The aasimar laughed quietly to herself; somehow the late paladin's all made sense now.

The Leonin twins tried to rob the military, but to no avail, as they haven't harmed anyone in the process, Aurinka, frustrated, let them off with a quiet warning.

The contents of the will were said to be contained in a secret basement within the estate, to which Lerlund led the others in. Within the dark basement was contained a smithy and several magical stones/gems, presumably used to craft **something.**

As they travelled they came across a devil's statue, which gave out riddles to everyone. Lerlund was the first, succeeding at the riddle quite easily. The other's weren't so lucky.
Aurinka lost 2 sanity (out of 10)
Rion and Barlast had it the worst, losing out on 4 sanity.

Contents of each chest:
1 a rainbow orb (?)
2 Potion of Hell Giant Strength
3 Godwin's diary

They found a head of a green dragon
That reminded Lerlund and Aurinka of a case 3 Years Ago on New Years Eve. 
The Disappearance of Lord Varkrok the Green.
Varkok was a known green dragon who frequently disguised himself as a human to participate in slave auctions. He had disappeared 3 years ago.
His severed head now hangs mounted on a wall.

**Owaris** god of feasts, sex love and parties.

Lerlund was later ambushed by 2 drow assasins of the crown, (Marked by the black emblem they wore), with the party including Aurinka coming for support. 

As they fight them one the drows commands Aurinka to kill Lerlund to which, while conflicted, she hesitates for a moment, claiming Lerlund to be innocent, but when the assassin taunted her with Arkhan's name, she'd snap and ends up killing the last one with a fire bolt.

The voice of Arkhan the cruel would echo in her mind after the encounter. 
The voice accused her of betrayal and threatened her with another course of brainwashing. And this time, he would take care of all lose ends.

This would scar Aurinka once more and knowing she wouldn't be able to lie her way through the zone of truth that would follow suit, she ends up having a panic attack until  Rion calms her down.

Symbol of **Belial**
![Symbol of Belial.png](/img/user/Vaz%20Campaign/VImages/Symbol%20of%20Belial.png)


Hooty, Vittoria's old pet she buried under a black/burned(?) star. 

Was stuck in the basement for 3 years
![Hooty.png](/img/user/Vaz%20Campaign/VImages/Hooty.png)

As Aurinka and Lerlund talked to Hooty, trying to calm the excited owl amalgamation down, the owl would show the gift it had crafted for Vittoria, using the gems the party had seen in the beginning of the basement. 

**A sorcerer's spellfocus**

Lerlund would slip up by accident and reveal to Aurinka that Vittoria seemed be a sorcerer.

Later on Rion attempted to pick up the dagger, which revealed itself to be a mimic.

In the ensuing fight Rion was forced to reveal her magical capabilities to fight and heal Aurinka, who had sustained grave injuries against the mimic. 
Afterward Aurinka used her healing hands on Rion and the tiefling would heal the aasimar in return once again, signaling a faint but existing sign of trust.

Although not verbally said, Aurinka would keep Rion's magical capabilities a secret.
