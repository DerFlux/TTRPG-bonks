Games will be heavily roleplay-focused, with combat encounters included.
When they do take place, Basilikum will design them as epic and cinematic as possible.

# **Trigger warnings:** 

- Body horror (Descriptions, not vivid images)
- Imperialism
- Fascism (Racism included ofc)
- Raiding (E.g. Kingdom raiding it's people)
- Political and Religious commentary, 
- SA might be brought up (possibly. Won't be visually shown.)
- Capitalism

# Encounters 

will include Homebrew monsters, except  in randomly rolled encounters.

**Difficulty curve:**
Level 1-4: Encounters will be very easy.
Level 5+: Risk of death or other issues will become possible.

Short rest opportunities almost every time outside of combat.
Long rest's every 2 - 3 sessions

Levels are milestone/event based within the story.
Level 2 might be in 2 - 3 sessions from now.

Campaign might go up to level 20.

## PART OF THE OLD CAMPAIGN

Gods of the settings are not that known, excluding the people who have known them or their avatar.

For the Paladin and Cleric (Me :D): You worship the concept and not the god themself. (E.g. you worship the sea and the storms, not Poseidon/Umberlee/Talos.)

In-game time will mostly be at sea. (One session in sea, one session in land, multiple sessions in land, then some sessions travelling to an island)
